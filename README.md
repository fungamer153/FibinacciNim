## Fibonacci Nim
A simple game, consisting of 2 players with a customisable heap amount & coins per heap count to provide entertainment for maybe an hour.

# How to play
1) Launch the game, then input the heap you wish to choose within the legally allowed count (1 - x)
2) Choose how many coins you wish to take, on first take of any heap you can only take `n - 1` coins
3) Play until the death!, last player to take a coin wins!
4) [Optiona] Select negative of a heap to reset it ONCE eg: `-1` - Will reset the 1st heap of coins back to the max

# How to customize
Top of the code includes easy to follow comments & variables to change for how many coins you wish to have per heap, alongside how many heaps there are
